# Acura Car Model Year Classification

## Overview

This repository contains a machine learning model developed using Teachable Machine to classify Acura car models by their production year based on images. This project demonstrates the application of image classification techniques to identify different car models and their respective years.

## Project Details

### Car Models Included

The dataset used in this project includes the following Acura car models:

- **Acura Integra Type R 2001**
- **Acura RL Sedan 2012**
- **Acura TL Sedan 2012**
- **Acura TL Type-S 2008**
- **Acura TSX Sedan 2012**
- **Acura ZDX Hatchback 2012**

### Dataset

The dataset consists of images of the above-mentioned car models. Each image is labeled according to the car model and year it represents. The images were collected and organized to ensure diverse angles and conditions to improve model robustness.

### Model

The model was built using Teachable Machine, which allowed for an intuitive and user-friendly approach to creating a classification model. The model is trained to recognize and classify images into one of the specified car models based on the year of production.

## Installation

To run this project locally, you will need:

- **Python 3.x** (for any further custom implementations or evaluations)
- **Teachable Machine** account (for model deployment and testing)

## Usage

1. **Train the Model**: Upload images to Teachable Machine and label them according to the car models and years.
2. **Evaluate the Model**: Use the Teachable Machine interface to test the model’s accuracy with new images.
3. **Deploy the Model**: Utilize the generated model for classification tasks, either through Teachable Machine’s web interface or by exporting the model for use in a custom application.

## Results

The model achieved promising results in classifying images into their respective car models and production years. Accuracy metrics and confusion matrices are available in the Teachable Machine dashboard.

## Future Work

Future enhancements could include:

- Expanding the dataset with additional car models and years.
- Implementing data augmentation techniques to improve model generalization.
- Integrating the model into a web or mobile application for real-time classification.
